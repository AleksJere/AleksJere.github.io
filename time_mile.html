            <h2>System & Components List</h2>
            <p>In our search to find a technique to control our stepper motors we arrived at Adin and Ming, both TAs had already constructed a robotic arm.
                We spoke with Adin and he recommended a company named trinamic for the stepper driver, 
                these are high quality stepper drivers able to withstand high voltages of up to 64 volts and 4 amps continuous current. 
                From our search we landed upon the TMC 2652C-LA stepper driver. from the drivers datasheet 
                we were able to find a breakout board for testing the driver which we modeled our PCB around. 
                Our next step involved finding smd components and computing the right capacitor, resistor components to place on our chip along with the correct MOSFETs. 
                Here we used the TMC 262C-LA datasheet where they provided many options for MOSFETs and we chose based on a few factors, maximum continous current, 
                maximum gate source voltage and a MOSFET with a common footprint to make it easier to place on our PCB. 
                We still however constructed our own footprint for our MOSFETs after running into some issues.

            <h2>CAD & Printing</h2>
            <p>
In our Timeline we have been working to construct and develop a CAD model for our arm which we can split into three parts. Our proposed design for our arm was decided upon on October 23 2024 with 2 supplemental pictures of sketches below.


Our original plan was to use servos in certain places, we quickly scrapped that idea as Adin and Ming talked to us about using steppers and we switched from a servo based on arm design to a stepper based design which has all the motors on the bottom acting with pulleys similar to a crane. Below we show the crane-like system
<br>

<br>
We continued planning out this system untill we had a conversation with Ming where he spoke about how alot of things in industry use pulleys and belts with ball bearings to transfer torque from the base to the other parts of the arm. so we switched onto that approach, here we can see the front back view with sets of rods that are connected through holes in the arms, these are connected either to exert torque or to transfer torque further along the system.

<br>
Here we can see a multilayer system with belts.

We have placed a time to finish for the design by the middle of week 6, currently Purab is working on constructing the base which is to rotate and hold all the stepper motors, Aleksandar is working on the upper arm and forearm, and Syler is working on the claw. By early week 6 we expect to have simulation of joints and then manufacture our pulley system.

here is an end of week 5 gif of the arm dynamics in action on Onshape

            <h2>R&D for PCB</h2>
            <p>Our PCB was made with the intention to be able to fully load our stepper motors over extended periods of time, we specified many different MOSFETs to deal with our design, we also took
            into considerations our maximum torques and forces so our stepper motor can produce enough torque. Here we used the methodology of over exaggerating our torque loads to make certain our arm
            meets our standards for picking up objects.</p>

            <h2>Component Testing</h2>
            <p>After the design phase of our project, we will shift to system integration which will start confirming the feasibility of our system design by testing our components mesh with each other, here we will work on encoding motors individually and begin building our 
               belts and pulley system for the arm. We will also begin to work with DIB on the prusa XL to begin printing our arm, here we will need to get confirmations from different sources to allow for the printing
                and we expect to be reasonably complete with our printing and set up by this deadline (11/21)</p>

            <h2>Coding Inverse Kinematic Control</h2>
            <p>
As of week 6 we should receive a premade controller for the stepper to begin constructing our code for control, we expect ourselves to finish implementing initial simple joystick commands to motor movements before we work on inverse kinematics. We are searching for and attempting to model the base using a state space system and we are also looking at papers on inverse kinematics to make sure we are moving forward.

We expect to be finishing our inverse kinematics modelling by the end of week 6 and hopefully able to implement some simulation results by early week 7.

A very intense scheduling can see us getting to testing our entire setup by the end of week 7 or early week 8

            <h2>Demoing</h2>
            <p>Here we are testing and demoing our robot arm to see what extent there is failures in where it can position and difficulties we can report in our project as things to improve or 
            shortcomings of our design and ways to improve and iterate upon as the final piece to our design (12/03 final class day)</p>

            <h2>And Beyond</h2>
            <p>We hope to make a robot and after so much time spent on this project it would be a shame to not continue to improve on our design past the course deadlines
                and create a robot arm we can proudly say we worked on untill we deem it to be the best of our abilities. (TBD after this quarter)</p>
