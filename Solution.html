        <p>Our proposed idea to alleviate some of the physical struggles experienced by individuals with disabilities, 
            is a robotic arm that could be mounted in various places that can be used for performing basic tasks like picking up objects and opening cabinets.
            In our Problem statement we show an article by the CDC about the difficulty for people with physical disabilities and 'a physical environment that is not accessible,'
            Our idea is to create a robot arm capable of helping people with disabilities (specifically in wheelchairs) to be able to reach parts of their home to make it easier to store items
            and create an environment which could create joy for someone with said disabilties. For instance being able to use cabinets might seem like a ridiculous thing for regularly abled people
            to fantasize over but for someone who has never been able to store things in cabinets it might be a huge quality of life improvement!

        We will implement a 4 stepper motor design placed on our 3D printed base which will be able to rotate to give a 3D sphere of reach for the arm, the arm will be powered through a power supply supplying
        24 volts up to 16 Amps, the arm will use inverse kinematics to easily map joystick movements into 3D end effector movements.
	The joystick will connect to the esp32 Dev Module which will then connect to our PCBs as we can see in our system diagram above.

	 <h>Testable Hypothesis</h1>
	</header>

	We will test our hypothesis by demoing the ease of control of our robot arm, this arm will be easy to control and be able to pick up simple household objects and open cabinets.
	our demo will involve picking up an apple and opening a cabinet to show the use of the item to reach things that could be out of their reach.
