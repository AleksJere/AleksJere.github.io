### Problem followed by our solution
Over 1.3 billion people across the globe are afflicted with disabilities that make leading a normal life difficult compared to able-bodied people. More specifically, another arm or hand could make maneuvering around or reaching essentials much easier. We are considering mainly people who are affected with trauma injuries or medical conditions which leave them in wheelchairs. Our solution involves creating a mountable highly accurate robotic arm which can be placed on a counter to help these people reach higher areas in their house.

My name is Aleksandar Jeremic. I am a 3rd year transfer ECE student at UCSD and my depth is Machine Learning And Controls. I enjoy playing sports, video games and spending time with my friends, I am often in Envision either distracting my friends from their work or getting distracted myself. I also TA for ECE 5 and hope this project is something I can be proud to show as a reachable goal for an undergraduate student interested in control theory. I also am interested in Devices and Material Science and am currently researching defects in magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs)

### Milestones and Timeline -- we should meet and agree on how to improve this im just setting a small outline with a few things


#### MCAD - Onshape

In our Timeline we have been working to construct and develop a CAD model for our arm which we can split into three parts. Our proposed design for our arm was decided upon on October 23 2024 with 2 supplemental pictures of sketches below
