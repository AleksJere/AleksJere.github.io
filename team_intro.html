            My name is Purab Balani. I am a 3rd year transfer Computer Engineering student in the ECE department focused on autonomous systems. I am currently in an autonomous systems lab and have also been part of a medical robotics lab. I also have a side project developing an autonomous go-kart with connections I have made over my few college years. Outside of academics, I love playing soccer and working out as well as hanging out with friends. I am interested in working with autonomous systems and robotics in the future integrating them together.

            <p>My name is Aleksandar Jeremic. I am a 3rd year transfer ECE student at UCSD and my depth is Machine Learning And Controls.
                 I enjoy playing sports, video games and spending time with my friends, I am often in Envision either distracting my friends from their work or getting distracted myself. 
                 I also TA for ECE 5 and hope this project is something I can be proud to show as a reachable goal for an undergraduate student interested in control theory. 
                 I also am interested in Devices and Material Science and am currently researching defects in magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs)</p>
