            <h2>Purab Balani</h2>
            <p>My name is Purab Balani. 
            I am a 3rd year transfer Computer Engineering student in the ECE department focused on autonomous systems. 
            I am currently in an autonomous systems lab and have also been part of a medical robotics lab. 
            I also have a side project developing an autonomous go-kart with connections I have made over my few college years.
            Outside of academics, I love playing soccer and working out as well as hanging out with friends. 
            I am interested in working with autonomous systems and robotics in the future integrating them together.</p>

            <h2>Aleksandar Jeremic</h2>
            <p>My name is Aleksandar Jeremic. 
            I am a 3rd year transfer ECE student at UCSD and my depth is Machine Learning And Controls.
            I enjoy playing sports, video games and spending time with my friends, I am often in Envision either distracting my friends from their work or getting distracted myself. 
            I also TA for ECE 5 and hope this project is something I can be proud to show as a reachable goal for an undergraduate student interested in control theory. 
            I also am interested in Devices and Material Science and am currently researching defects in magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs)</p>

            <h2>Syler Sylvester</h2>
            <p>Hi I'm Syler Sylvester.
			I am in the last quarter of my undergraduate program at UCSD. I will be receiving my B.S. in Electrical Engineering with a depth in Machine Learning & Controls,
			then start my master's program at UCSD in Intelligent Systems, Robotics, & Controls. Outside of school, I spend the majority of my time with friends, going to our
			favorite spots in San Diego. I also have been working with a startup and ARCLab at UCSD along with my school work. I would like to pursue a career in robotics and stay
			in San Diego if possible.</p>
