        <p>Over 1.3 billion people across the globe are afflicted with disabilities that make leading a normal life difficult compared to able-bodied people.
        More specifically, another arm or hand could make maneuvering around or reaching essentials much easier. 
        We are considering mainly people who are affected with trauma injuries or medical conditions which leave them in wheelchairs. 
        Our solution involves creating a mountable highly accurate robotic arm which can be placed on a counter in their homes to help these people reach higher areas in their house.
        Our problem tasks us with an accomodation issue of trying to make as easy and simple yet effective of an inclusion product as possible.
