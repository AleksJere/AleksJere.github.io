        <p>Over 1.3 billion people across the globe are afflicted with disabilities that make leading a normal life difficult compared to able-bodied people.
        More specifically, another arm or hand could make maneuvering around or reaching essentials much easier. 
        We are considering mainly people who are affected with trauma injuries or medical conditions which leave them in wheelchairs. 
        Our solution involves creating a mountable highly accurate robotic arm which can be placed on a counter to help these people reach higher areas in their house.
